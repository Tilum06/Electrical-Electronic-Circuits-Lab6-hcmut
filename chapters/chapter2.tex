\subsection{Self bias configuration}
This is the first configuration for a JET, when a gate pin is connected to a Ground. A typical circuit is presented as follows:

    \caption{Self bias configuration}
    \label{fig:jfet_self_bias}
\end{figure}

Students are proposed to implement this circuit in PSPICE with the JFET  is JbeakN. The simulation results in PSPICE (bias configuration) are presented here.  Moreover, a short explanations are required in this report to explain the value of $I_D$ and $V_{GS}$.
